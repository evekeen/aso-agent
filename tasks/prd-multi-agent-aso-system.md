# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent ASO Research System

## Introduction/Overview

This feature transforms the existing single-workflow ASO research system into a multi-agent orchestrated platform that automatically discovers, analyzes, and reports on promising app opportunities. The system will use a supervisor agent to coordinate specialized agents that handle app idea generation, market analysis, competitor research, and automated reporting.

**Problem Statement:** The current ASO research system requires manual app idea input and lacks automated competitive analysis and stakeholder communication. This manual process limits scalability and delays decision-making for app development opportunities.

**Goal:** Create an autonomous multi-agent system that discovers trending app opportunities from social media, analyzes market potential using existing ASO tools, researches competitive positioning, and delivers actionable insights via automated reports.

## Goals

1. **Automated App Discovery:** Generate app ideas from social media trends and user complaints/requests
2. **Intelligent Market Analysis:** Leverage existing ASO analysis tools to evaluate market potential  
3. **Competitive Intelligence:** Research brand positioning and differentiation strategies for promising apps
4. **Autonomous Reporting:** Deliver periodic insights via email with detailed analysis accessible via web interface
5. **Scalable Coordination:** Enable supervisor-managed workflow that can handle multiple concurrent analyses
6. **Quality Filtering:** Identify promising opportunities using data-driven criteria ($50K+ market, <4.0 difficulty, >0.5 traffic)

## User Stories

**As an ASO researcher, I want the system to automatically discover trending app ideas so that I don't miss emerging market opportunities.**

**As a business stakeholder, I want to receive periodic email reports with promising app opportunities so that I can make informed investment decisions.**

**As a product manager, I want detailed competitive analysis for promising apps so that I can understand how to differentiate our potential products.**

**As a developer, I want to access detailed market data via a web interface so that I can dive deep into specific opportunities.**

**As an operations manager, I want the system to run autonomously on a schedule so that research continues without manual intervention.**

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture
1.1. The system must implement a supervisor agent using LangGraph's multi-agent patterns
1.2. The supervisor must coordinate workflow between specialized agents
1.3. Each agent must handle failures gracefully and report status to supervisor
1.4. The system must support both scheduled and manual execution triggers

### 2. App Idea Generation Agent
2.1. The agent must search Reddit for posts containing app requests, complaints, and trending discussions within the last 24 hours
2.2. The agent must search Product Hunt for trending products and user feedback
2.3. The agent must autonomously discover relevant subreddits for monitoring
2.4. The agent must extract and synthesize app ideas from social media content
2.5. The agent must limit analysis to maximum 20 app ideas per cycle to manage resources
2.6. The agent must implement rate limiting to respect API restrictions

### 3. Market Analysis Integration
3.1. The system must use existing ASO analysis nodes from src/agent/graph.py
3.2. The system must process app ideas through the existing keyword generation → app search → market size → difficulty analysis pipeline
3.3. The system must apply promising app criteria: minimum $50K market size, maximum 4.0 difficulty rating, minimum 0.5 traffic rating
3.4. The system must cache analysis results to avoid redundant API calls

### 4. Marketer Agent
4.1. The agent must research top 3 competitors for promising apps based on highest-value keywords
4.2. The agent must analyze competitor positioning, pricing strategies, and key differentiators  
4.3. The agent must generate brand positioning recommendations
4.4. The agent must create differentiation strategy suggestions
4.5. The agent must deliver structured competitive intelligence reports

### 5. Supervisor Coordination
5.1. The supervisor must update users via web interface chat about analysis progress
5.2. The supervisor must categorize apps as "promising" or "non-promising" based on defined criteria
5.3. The supervisor must route promising apps to marketer agent for competitive analysis
5.4. The supervisor must collect and aggregate all agent outputs into final reports
5.5. The supervisor must handle agent failures and retry logic

### 6. Email Reporting Agent
6.1. The agent must send periodic reports to aso@ivkin.dev
6.2. Email must contain executive summary with key metrics and promising opportunities
6.3. Email must include link to detailed web interface with full analysis, tables, and charts
6.4. The agent must send reports even when no promising apps are found, including research summary
6.5. Email format must be professional and actionable for business stakeholders

### 7. Web Interface Integration
7.1. The system must provide real-time chat interface showing supervisor status updates
7.2. The interface must display detailed analysis results with tables and visualizations
7.3. The interface must allow manual triggering of analysis cycles
7.4. The interface must show historical analysis results and trends

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Building new ASO analysis algorithms (use existing tools)
- Real-time social media monitoring (daily batch processing only)
- Multi-language social media analysis (English only initially)
- Automated app development or publishing
- Financial modeling beyond market size estimation
- Integration with app stores for automated publishing

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Build on existing LangGraph framework and State management
- Integrate with current ASO analysis pipeline in src/agent/graph.py
- Use existing cache store (aso_cache.db) for data persistence
- Implement browser automation tool for social media scraping

### Dependencies
- LangGraph multi-agent supervisor patterns
- Reddit API or web scraping capabilities  
- Product Hunt API integration
- Email sending capabilities (SMTP or service integration)
- Web framework for frontend interface
- Rate limiting and API quota management

### Data Flow
1. Supervisor triggers app idea generation agent
2. Ideas flow to existing ASO analysis pipeline
3. Promising apps route to marketer agent
4. All results aggregate in supervisor
5. Email agent sends summary reports
6. Web interface displays detailed analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Limit concurrent social media API requests
- Cache social media data to avoid re-fetching
- Use existing ASO cache for market data
- Implement background job processing for long-running analysis

## Success Metrics

### Operational Metrics
- System uptime and successful daily execution rate >95%
- Average analysis cycle completion time <2 hours
- API rate limit violations <5% of requests
- Agent failure and recovery rate

### Business Metrics  
- Number of promising apps identified per week
- Market size accuracy of identified opportunities
- Time-to-insight reduction compared to manual research
- Stakeholder engagement with reports (email opens, web interface usage)

### Quality Metrics
- Relevance of discovered app ideas (human evaluation sample)
- Accuracy of competitive analysis recommendations
- False positive rate for "promising" app classification

## Open Questions

1. **Web Interface Technology:** What frontend framework should be used for the web interface? (React, Vue, or server-side rendered?)

2. **Social Media Access:** Should we use official APIs (requiring keys/costs) or web scraping for Reddit/Product Hunt data?

3. **Competitive Analysis Depth:** What specific competitive intelligence should the marketer agent collect beyond positioning and differentiation?

4. **Report Frequency:** Should email reports be daily, weekly, or triggered only when promising apps are found?

5. **Multi-User Support:** Should the web interface support multiple users or remain single-user initially?

6. **Data Retention:** How long should historical analysis data be retained in the system?

7. **Alert Thresholds:** Should the system alert for exceptionally high-value opportunities (e.g., >$500K market) immediately rather than waiting for scheduled reports?
