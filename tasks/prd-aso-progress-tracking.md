# Product Requirements Document: ASO Analysis Progress Tracking

## Introduction/Overview

The ASO Analysis Progress Tracking feature provides real-time visibility into the execution of ASO (App Store Optimization) analysis workflows. Currently, users experience anxiety during long-running analyses (which can take 5+ minutes) as they cannot see what the system is doing or whether it's functioning properly. This feature addresses this problem by providing detailed progress updates, thought processes, and execution logs similar to how OpenAI or Claude displays progress during deep research tasks.

The system consists of a distributed architecture with a LangGraph orchestrator and microservices (particularly a Playwright service for web scraping), requiring progress tracking across multiple components to provide a unified view of the analysis process.

## Goals

1. **Reduce User Anxiety**: Provide clear visual indicators that the system is actively working and making progress
2. **Enable Debugging**: Allow developers and analysts to trace execution details for troubleshooting and optimization
3. **Improve User Experience**: Display progress in an intuitive, OpenAI/Claude-style thought process format
4. **Support Multiple Interfaces**: Work seamlessly whether accessed via MCP server or custom frontend
5. **Provide Traceability**: Enable post-execution analysis of what happened during a specific task

## User Stories

1. **As an ASO analyst**, I want to see which keywords are currently being processed so that I know the system is working and estimate completion time
2. **As a product manager**, I want to understand the thought process behind the analysis so that I can validate the approach and explain results to stakeholders
3. **As a developer**, I want to access detailed execution logs and error information so that I can debug issues and optimize performance
4. **As a user**, I want to see progress updates that persist across browser refreshes so that I don't lose context if my connection is interrupted
5. **As a team member**, I want to reference the execution trace of a completed analysis so that I can understand how results were derived

## Functional Requirements

### Core Progress Tracking
1. The system must display real-time progress updates for each workflow step (collect ideas → generate keywords → search apps → analyze difficulty → generate report)
2. The system must show detailed sub-progress for long-running operations (e.g., "Processing keyword 15 of 43" during difficulty analysis)
3. The system must display elapsed time for the overall analysis and individual steps
4. The system must show the current "thought process" or reasoning behind each step
5. The system must persist progress state across page refreshes and browser sessions

### Error Handling and Retry Tracking
6. The system must display error messages and retry attempts with clear context
7. The system must show when operations timeout and are being retried
8. The system must indicate which specific keywords or operations failed and why
9. The system must display recovery actions being taken (e.g., falling back to cached data)

### Multi-Service Coordination
10. The system must aggregate progress from both LangGraph nodes and microservices (Playwright service)
11. The system must correlate progress updates using unique task/request identifiers
12. The system must handle progress updates when services are distributed across different processes/servers
13. The system must gracefully handle cases where progress tracking fails without breaking the main workflow

### Interface Requirements
14. The system must provide a polling-based API endpoint for progress updates (acceptable latency: 1-2 seconds)
15. The system must work when the ASO analysis is called as an MCP server
16. The system must work when accessed through a custom frontend interface
17. The system must provide a consistent progress format across all access methods

### Data and Storage
18. The system must store progress data in memory during execution (no persistent storage required)
19. The system must include timestamp information for all progress events
20. The system must provide structured progress data that can be easily consumed by different UI frameworks
21. The system must clean up progress data after task completion to prevent memory leaks

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Task Cancellation**: Users cannot cancel or modify running analyses (future enhancement)
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users cannot collaboratively view the same analysis progress
3. **Historical Progress Storage**: Progress data is not persisted to database after task completion
4. **WebSocket/SSE Streaming**: Real-time push notifications are not required (polling is acceptable)
5. **Mobile-optimized UI**: Progress tracking is designed for desktop/web interfaces only
6. **Performance Monitoring**: System performance metrics and alerting are separate concerns
7. **Multi-tenant Progress**: Progress tracking for multiple concurrent users is not the primary focus

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Progress display should mirror the OpenAI/Claude thought process style with expandable sections
- Visual indicators should include progress bars, step indicators, and status icons
- The interface should clearly distinguish between completed, in-progress, and pending operations
- Error states should be prominently displayed with actionable information

### Technical Architecture
- Progress tracking should be implemented as a separate concern from business logic
- Each LangGraph node should emit progress events at key milestones
- The Playwright service should report detailed sub-task progress
- A progress aggregation service should combine updates from multiple sources
- Progress data should be structured to support different UI representations

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing LangGraph workflow definition
- Must work with the current Playwright microservice architecture
- Should leverage existing correlation ID pattern for request tracking
- Must not significantly impact performance of the main analysis workflow

### Data Format
- Progress events should include: timestamp, task_id, node_name, progress_percentage, current_operation, elapsed_time, and status
- Error events should include: error_type, error_message, retry_count, and recovery_action
- Sub-task progress should be aggregated into overall workflow progress

### Performance Requirements
- Progress updates should not add more than 5% overhead to analysis execution time
- Progress polling should support at least 10 concurrent users without performance degradation
- Progress data should be cleaned up within 1 hour of task completion

## Success Metrics

1. **User Satisfaction**: Reduced support tickets about "system hanging" or "analysis stuck"
2. **Debugging Efficiency**: Developers can identify and resolve issues 50% faster using progress traces
3. **User Engagement**: Users are more likely to wait for long-running analyses to complete
4. **System Reliability**: Improved ability to detect and diagnose system issues through detailed progress logs

## Open Questions

1. **Concurrent Analysis Handling**: How should progress tracking behave when multiple analyses are running simultaneously?
2. **Progress Granularity**: What level of detail should be shown for each microservice operation?
3. **Error Recovery UX**: Should users be notified about automatic retry attempts or only final failures?
4. **Mobile Interface**: Should a simplified mobile-friendly progress view be considered for future iterations?
5. **Performance Impact**: What is the acceptable performance overhead for progress tracking?
6. **Integration Testing**: How should progress tracking be tested across the distributed system components?
